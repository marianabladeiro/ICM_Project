# PomodoroUA

PomodoroUA is a productivity mobile app for students of _Universidade de Aveiro_, which includes a timer based on the Pomodoro technique.

## Motivation

The idea came from being previously familiar with the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). There was also a suggestion to apply this concept towards an app for students from _Universidade de Aveiro_ instead of users in general, as previously planned.

## How to run the application

#### Login in the app with one of following accounts:

| Email         | Password  |
| ------------- | ----------|
| a@ua.pt       | apassword |
| b@ua.pt       | bpassword |
| c@ua.pt       | cpassword |

## Resources

A more detailed description of the application, its features and technologies used are mentioned in the `.pdf` report of this repository.
